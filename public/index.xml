      <description>Since we are using GitHub for hosting and updating the site, we can leverage the functionality of Git to allow everyone to make contributions to the site. However, a few rules must be followed for this to continue to be viable as a documentation solution.
No internal information. This site is very public. Anybody with the url can navigate here. Therefore, documentation here should be restricted to resources and techniques that can be learned from other publicly available resources.</description>

      <description>This section contains miscelaneous guides and walkthroughs that may be useful. If you do something that you don&amp;rsquo;t see in this section, please consider creating a walkthrough for it. We can always work together to make it pretty and more robust, but just getting something written down is invaluable to our effectiveness as a team.</description>

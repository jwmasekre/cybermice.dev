Cyberchef has an incredibly vast suite of operations for manipulating data. It's publicly available, but Security Onion bundles one in just in case analysts don't have an internet connection. The best way to learn CyberChef is to explore the operations and participate in capture-the-flags that incorporate data manipulation (such as base64 encoding, ROT13 encoding, looking at hexdumps, etc.).

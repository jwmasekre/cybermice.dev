This page is largely uninteresting for the purposes of the lab. In distributed instances, this would return all the different nodes and report on their status. The only important part of Grid from our view is the Container Status section; if a component is down or unhealthy, you can pivot to [Hunt](./hunt) to diagnose the problem from here instead of ssh'ing into the vm and doing it through the CLI.

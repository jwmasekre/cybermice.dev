InfluxDB is a monitor for the Security Onion nodes. It gives a good idea of current usage, and will alert on suspected issues. For the most part, as long as nothing is red, you're good; Low PCAP retention will go away as more traffic flows, and Low Traffic Volume is normal for a low-activity network such as this. Our Security Onion is a bit light on memory, so that will probably be pretty high in utilization as well.

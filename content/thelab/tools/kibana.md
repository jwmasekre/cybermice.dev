Kibana is the frontend of the ELK stack-- Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Security Onion ships all of its logs to the ELK stack, so Kibana is very useful for exploring the data in a more thorough way than is possible in the Hunt interface. It also is significantly more customizable, though the default dashboards are very functional and easy to use.

We won't go into a deep dive here, but the best way to learn what all is available to you is to explore the Navigation panel that is built-in to the Security Onion default dashboard.

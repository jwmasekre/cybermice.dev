Playbook has (as of time of writing) over 2000 detection playbooks built-in to the Security Onion. Detection playbooks are a combination of Sigma rules and actions to take upon a match. By default, all playbooks shipped with Security Onion are in a Draft status; to enable them, check all of them (using the top left check) and click a three-dot menu button on the right of one that's highlighted, mouse over status and click Active. Once active and tripped, Playbooks typically generate alerts in the [Alerts](./alerts) page.

New Plays can be created to build custom detections; this will be covered in future scenarios.

Security Onion 2.4 has migrated the multiple toolsets for endpoint monitoring into the Elastic Agent. The Downloads page is the source for installer files. As long as the endpoint is properly added to the firewall rules (see [Administration](./administration#configuration)), installation is as simple as running the executable. Once installed, the agents and the devices they run on can be viewed and managed via [Elastic Fleet](./elasticfleet) and queried for data via [Osquery Manager](./osquerymanager).
